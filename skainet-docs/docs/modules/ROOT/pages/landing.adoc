== Why teams trust Skainet

[.value-card.icon-orbit.accent-emerald]
=== Adaptive situational awareness
Stream telemetry from edge devices, satellites, and control rooms into one adaptive knowledge graph that highlights anomalies before they escalate.

[.value-card.icon-core.accent-violet]
=== Decision core that learns
Deploy reinforcement-trained policies that blend deterministic safety rails with real-time learning to handle uncertain environments.

[.value-card.icon-shield.accent-amber]
=== Continuous assurance
Auto-issue evidence packs for compliance and safety reviews with lineage tracking for every command, response, and override.
