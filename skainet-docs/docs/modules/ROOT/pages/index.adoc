[abstract]
Welcome to the Skainet documentation portal. Begin with hands-on tutorials to spin up your first control node, jump into practical guides to solve operational tasks, explore the architecture behind the neural decision core, and consult API references when integrating with external systems.

== Your Documentation Map

The Skainet docs are organized around the Divio documentation system:

* Tutorials – step-by-step journeys that get you to a working result quickly.
* How-to Guides – task-focused instructions for day-to-day operations.
* Explanation – background and conceptual knowledge to understand the why.
* Reference – authoritative technical specifications and API contracts.

=== Tutorials

Kick off with the xref:tutorials/first-boot.adoc[Boot Skainet Core tutorial] to provision an intelligence cluster, connect field units, and confirm telemetry flow.

=== How-to Guides

Use the xref:how-to/calibrate-sensors.adoc[Calibrate Sensor Array guide] to keep your sentinel grid performing with precision in live environments.

=== Explanation

Gain context from xref:explanation/decision-core.adoc[Decision Core Overview], covering how inference modules, safety switches, and ethics circuits interact.

=== Reference

Integrate Skainet into automation pipelines using the xref:reference/control-api.adoc[Control API Reference], detailing endpoints, payloads, and example responses.
