Follow these steps whenever a Skainet sentinel grid reports drift in environmental readings.

== Before You Begin

* Completed xref:tutorials/first-boot.adoc[Boot Skainet Core tutorial].
* Field units online and reachable.

== Procedure

. From the Operations Console, navigate to *Fleet > Calibration*.
. Select the target sensor cluster and choose *Run Auto-Calibrate*.
. Enter the ambient baseline values supplied by your field operators.
. Monitor the rolling telemetry chart and wait for variance to fall below 2%.
. Apply the calibration and store the snapshot.

== Troubleshooting

* If telemetry remains unstable, inspect unit firmware versions and apply available updates.
* For persistent divergence, open a ticket with inference logs attached.

== Related Information
