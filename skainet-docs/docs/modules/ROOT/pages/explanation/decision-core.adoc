= Decision Core Overview
:page-subtitle: Explanation

[abstract]
Understand how Skainet blends neural inference, rule-based safeguards, and ethical governors to provide reliable, auditable decisions.

== Architectural Layers

=== Inference Engines

Skainet hosts specialized neural graphs for threat detection, logistics planning, and anomaly prediction. Each graph runs on dedicated compute pods instrumented with telemetry hooks.

=== Safety Cortex

Rule-based guardrails evaluate inference results before actions are issued. Policies are versioned, testable, and support staged rollouts.

=== Ethics Governor

The ethics layer enforces organizational compliance constraints. It logs every override with contextual reasoning for audit trails.

== Data Flow

Sensor input streams enter the ingestion mesh, pass through normalization filters, then feed the active inference engines. Output decisions fan out to actuators via encrypted channels with acknowledgement tracking.
