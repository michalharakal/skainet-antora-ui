:page-subtitle: Tutorial

[abstract]
This tutorial walks you through deploying a minimal Skainet intelligence cluster, registering a field unit, and validating initial sensor telemetry.

== Prerequisites

* Access to the Skainet Operations Console.
* SSH connectivity to the target cluster nodes.
* Administrative credentials for the Skainet control plane.

== Step 1. Provision the Control Node

. Create a new cluster from the Operations Console and select the *Cobalt* blueprint.
. Download the generated bootstrap script and copy it to your control node.
. Run the script and wait for the `Ready` status to appear in the console.

== Step 2. Register the First Field Unit

. On the console, open *Fleet > Add Unit*.
. Scan or enter the unit provision token.
. Confirm the unit appears with a green heartbeat indicator.

== Step 3. Validate Telemetry Flow

. Execute `skainet ctl status --details` from your workstation.
. Verify the metrics stream displays `Sensors: nominal`.
. Celebrateâ€”your Skainet intelligence core is online.
